<h2>INFORMATION</h2>
<p><span style="font-family:inherit; font-size:1em">Are you a software engineer, web developer or graphic designer? Are you a marketer, or startup enthusiast? Come spend 12 hours to build a mobile app, web site or project that will make life better at Cal Poly and your community. It’s a day of hacking where you can think up ideas, pitch concepts to each other, join into teams to quickly build as much as you can, and present the results.</span></p>
<p>The Cal Poly Hackathon is a great way for you to make new connections, learn skills, and get feedback from mentors and your peers. It will be a creative, supportive environment – OK, maybe just a little bit competitive too. Bring your energy and enthusiasm and let’s build together.</p>
<p>During the Cal Poly Hackathon we will have experienced mentors on hand to help you with different technologies for development and design. On Saturday evening everyone will demo their product/website/mobile app and receive feedback from an expert panel. After voting by the judges, and by all of you, we will celebrate with some fun prizes.</p>
<p>Many past hackathons have led to job opportunities, internships and student teams forming start ups of their own, and we hope to see you join that notable list! The Cal Poly Hackathon is also a great résumé builder!</p>
<p>The event will be held in the Bonderson Engineering Center at Cal Poly in San Luis Obispo. You will need to be there on Friday evening February 7th for the kickoff night (6-8 pm). Bring your ideas and we will help everyone form teams. Hack on your project starting that Saturday morning and show your demo on Saturday evening. See the schedule below for more information. Plenty of food and refreshments will be provided, just bring your own computer.</p>
<h5>How to Sign Up</h5>
<p>Help us get the right mix of participants by picking the right ticket: if you can code, pick the Developer/Engineer ticket (50 available). Can you do HTML or visual design but not code? Pick the Designer/UX ticket (50 available). Content developer, marketer or startup enthusiast? Pick "Marketer/Idea Person" (20 available). There is no charge to attend but we can only fit a limited number of people so sign up early!!</p>
